# Connect Four Game The Odin Project

Connect Four Game using composition, the module pattern, factory functions, webpack

This game only have 1 difficulty that the BOT play random moves.
But it seems nearly impossible (and kinda interesting) to play a draw game with that bot (you can't either win or lose to it till the end)

The game can play with keyboard where 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 key to make a move and Enter to reset game

The game have 2 game modes: Human vs AI and Human vs Human

You can choose your mark when playing against AI (choose X to play first move)

I am going to update this game's difficulties after I learn Minimax algorithms (and know how to apply to this project :) )
